                <h1>So... who am I?</h1>
                <p>I am a Senior at the University of Akron.  I am majoring in Computer Engineering and minoring in Computer Science and Mathematics.  I live and breathe in code.  When I was 9, I created my own video game.  At age 12, I started teaching myself C++.  Now, as a 22 year old living in Akron, OH, I am preparing to apply my skills that I have learned to help others accomplish their dreams.</p>

                <h1 class="skills-maintitle">What sorts of things have I done?</h1>

                        <h3>Web Development</h3>
                        <p>If you need someone to create or edit your website, I'm your guy.  I bend HTML, CSS, and jQuery to their limits while I generate elegant, glowing code and a smooth user experience.  With allies such as Photoshop and Dreamweaver, my design abilities know no end.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="zoomable">
                        <h3>Application Development</h3>
                        <p>I have written countless applications for both mobile and desktop platforms, including everything from simple number conversions to complex hardware control systems.  I am passionate about each end every line of code that I write, and have spent many of my days perfecting my algorithms to behave quickly and accuratly. With tools like C++, Perl, and MATLAB, I can create anything that I can imagine.</p>

                    <li class="zoomable">
                        <h3>Hardware Design</h3>
                        <p>Hardware systems go together with code like bread and butter.  Whether it's designing a simple filter or creating an entire embedded system from stratch, I slave over the soldering iron until my circuits work flawlessly.</p>

                <h2 class="quote">"I believe Jake's greatest strength is his ability to work independently and figure things out for himself.  Jake was able to accept a task with a small amount of guidance, investigate it himself, and then develop his own solution.  He learns quickly and can self-teach which will be very beneficial in the computer engineering field."</h2>
